# **Adaptive Traffic Control with AI - Real-time Object Detection with YOLO** 
YOLO (You Only Look Once) is a Deep Convolutional Neural Network that performs object detection from images.

It solves two problems - 
1. A Classification problem - to identify the type of object (e.g. car, person, auto, traffic lights, etc.) - Predicts class labels with a confidence score.
2. A Regression problem - it localizes the detected object with a bounding box in the image (e.g. finds the location of the object in the entire image). - Predicts the location of the bounding box - (x,y) coordinate of the centre of the bounding box along with the width and height of the bounding box.


# Create a Custom Dataset
1. Collect new images (car, auto, bus, traffic lights, person, etc.)
2. Annotate images using a tool like **Label Studio**.
3. Save your annotated data in a zip file `YOLO_Data.zip`

# Model Training [`YOLO_Train.ipynb`]
4. Download a pre-trained YOLO model (e.g. Yolov11) from **Ultralytics**. Check **Quick Start** Step 3.
5. Train the YOLO model on **Google Colab** with GPU (Graphics Processing Unit, T4 GPU). Check **Quick Start** Step 4.
6. Save and download the newly trained YOLO model (e.g., **yolo11n.pt**). Check **Quick Start** Step 4.

# Deployment
7. Download the model on Raspberry-Pi-5.
8. Convert the .pt model to NCNN format (optimized for the ARM CPUs like the one Raspberry-Pi has). Check **Quick Start** Step 5.
9. Run the optimized model on the Raspberry-Pi. Check **Quick Start** Step 6.

## 🚀 Quickstart

### Run the following commands in the root project folder.

### 1. Create a Virtual Environment [On the Raspberry-Pi][Setup]

```bash
python -m venv yolo
```

### 2. Activate the Virtual Environment

```bash
# On your Laptop (Windows)
yolo/Scripts/activate
```
```bash
# On your Raspberry-Pi (running Raspberry Pi OS) [On the Raspberry-Pi]
source yolo/bin/activate
```
### 3. Install Requirements
After the virtual environment has been activated, you need to install the necessary libraries.

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
### 4. Train the YOLO model
Runs on the Google Colab platform.
i. Check the IPython notebook, `YOLO_Train.ipynb`. This file is self contained.  
ii. Upload your curated data filre `YOLO_Data.zip`. 
iii. Run all the cells sequentially. 
iv. After training is completed, a `yolov11.pt` file is created. Download this file and store it in the root project folder of the Raspberry-Pi board.

### 5. Convert the YOLO model from .pt to NCNN Format [On the Raspberry-Pi]
You need to convert the `yolov11.pt` to `yolov11_ncnn_model` 
```bash
python pt2ncnn.py
```

### 6. Run The Application (Object detection with YOLO on realtime video) [On the Raspberry-Pi]
```bash
python yolo_detect.py
```

## Note: 
Steps 1, 2, 3, 5, 6 are to be run either on a Laptop or a Raspberry-Pi board.

Step 1, 2, 3 are required to setup the environment and do the installations.

Step 5, 6 are required to run the application.

Step 4 is to be run on a Google Colab (or similar environment having a GPU access).
